# Coding-Challenge

This file contains my completion of the Coding Challenge.


Instructions on how to use this:

    1 - Clone the code
    2 - If needed, reinstall node files but it shouldn't be needed as I already have all dependencies installed
        (if needed here is how I installed it, npm install, npm i jest -D) Used for node modules and jest 
    3 - Make sure to be in the main directory
    4 - Do npm run start to run the code on your local machine
    5 - The link to get to the webtool should be localhost:4234/
    6 - The website should not be interactable and testable



BEFORE USING THE WEBPAGE:

    1 - This webtool only converts Weight Units, that being lbs, kgs, g, ounces, and mgs
    2 - In addition to conversions I also added a little calculation tool to add and subtract different units together
    3 - The weight convertor starts from left to right, for example if we want to convert lbs to kgs, we put lbs on the left
    where "From:" is indicated and kgs on the right where "To:" is indicated
    4 - This is also the same for my weight unit calculator. We are adding and subtracting from left to right, option1 will be the left
    and option2 is the right
    5 - For the weight unit calculator, input1 will be for option1 and input2 will be for option2
    6 - The weight unit calculator outputs the final value from left to right as well, first unit being the left and second unit being the right

Technologies used:

    - Javscript
    - node.js
    - Pug
    - Jest
